# Connect-SharkWeek
Public API for [Sharknado](https://github.com/Bernie-2016/Connect-Sharknado) using the [JSON API 1.0 Spec](http://jsonapi.org/)
[Newsfeed spec](https://github.com/Bernie-2016/Connect-Sharknado/issues/1)

## Development
Make sure you have the following installed:
* postgresql 9.4
* python 3.4

It's also recommended that you use `virtualenv`, `virtualenvwrapper`,
or a similar tool to keep your development environment isolated from
the rest of your system.

Install all requirements:
```bash
make develop
```

Test code quality:
```bash
make quality
```

## Production
App configuration is currently defined in the `/opt/bernie/config.yml`
file, which shares the same config settings as
[Sharknado](https://github.com/Bernie-2016/Connect-Sharknado).

### Sample config
```yaml
postgresql:
    dbname: __postgres__
    dbuser: __user__
    dbpass: __pass__
    host: __host__
